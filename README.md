# Reflection on GitHub Project Management Tools

Using GitHub's project management tools like milestones, issues, and project boards has made it easier to manage my portfolio project. Milestones help me break the project into smaller goals so I can focus on one thing at a time. Issues let me track specific tasks or problems, making sure I don't forget anything. By linking issues to milestones, I can stay organized and know what I need to do next. The project board shows me what’s done and what’s still to be completed.

One challenge I might face is forgetting to update the board. If I don't update tasks, it can get confusing. To fix this, I’ll make sure to check and update the board regularly. These tools help me stay organized and on track with my project.
